# Finance Calculator  
  This program was built in an effort to streamline the calculations I would manually perform (several times a week) to understand how my overall financial situation looked at the time.
  
  At the time of writing, this program supports six functions that are presented to the user through an interface that asks for their input. 
  
  The functions consist of the following:
  
  Option A) Takes the user through all the steps necessary to provide a complete picture of their current financial situation (includes pay and balance calculations, excludes savings          and investment return calculations).
  
  Option B) Calculates the user's current account balances and net & gross income.
  
  Option C) Calculates the user's net and gross income.
  
  Option D) Calculates the user's savings account returns (accounts for monthly contributions, the account's interest rate, and compound interest).
  
  Option E) Calculates one of two things: either the user's 401k investment returns or Roth IRA investment returns (accounts for company matching, compound interest, pre-tax contributions, etc.) 
  
  Option Z) Provides the user with a description of each options in the calculator that is available to them.
  
  

# Orders 
  This is a one-off project that was created within 3 hours. It is essentially a rudimentary ordering system for a hypothetical restaurant that enforces rules on what can, cannot, and must be ordered at each meal in the day.
